                    <h3>Dishanjali App</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dishanjali is a social welfare organization. The aim of Dishanjali is to teach child which are belong to poor background, which not have good opportunity to learn in big schools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So for that Dishanjali have coordinator for all center and there are 5 to 6 people under each coordinator which are responsible for teaching students. so the problem is to manage all this things and digitalize all coordinator, center , attendance and
                        all. so for that I have created two apps one for admin and other for coordinator and other user so that it is easy to manage all things by admin
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For development I used Android studio as IDE and firebase as database
